Tasks attempted:

1a) Process diagram included in the base directory:
	- AWT-A02 - MyVacation.svg
	- AWT-A02 - MyVacation.pdf

1b) Process and service interfaces:
	
	MyVacationWorkflow:
	GetStudentDataRequest
	Interface String[] GetCheapestHoliday(string university, string timeOfYear, Int32 budget, Int64 ccNumber);
	Returns 4 parameters bookingPrice (the total cost of holiday and transfer), bookingRef (a booking reference number),
	bookingItinerary (a full list of information needed for the trip), bookingDetails (additional information, used for
	explaining when the booking process can't find a suitable holiday)

	UniversityTermTimeService:
	Interface List<DateTime> GetHolidayDates(string university, string timeOfYear);
	Returns a list of 2 DateTime objects, the first of which is the day the University closes for
	vacation and the second is when term begins again

	HolidayBrokerService:
	Interface List<Holiday> GetHolidayOptions(DateTime startDate, DateTime endDate, int budget);
	Returns a list of Holiday objects which contains all information relevant to the package holiday

	AirportTransferService:
	Interface TravelOption GetCheapestTravelOption(string originCity, string destinationCity);
	Returns a TravelOption object which contains a mode of traffic for traveling from University to
	the airport and what the cost of the transfer would be

2) All 3 partner services implemented as C# services, relevant project directories are:
	- AirportTransferService
	- HolidayBrokerService
	- UniversityTermTimeService

3) Implementation of the designed process from 1a) as a WCF Workflow Service, project directory is:
	- MyVacationWorkflow

4) As each servive was build as a separate Visual Studio project getting preparing each service is as simple as 
right-clicking the project name and selecting "Publish..." and following the publishing wizard to deploy each one
as a Microsoft Azure App Service at a domain name of your choice.

Once the 3 external services are uploaded to Azure they can be referenced in my MyVacationWorkflow project as
"Connected Services". In the Solution Explorer I right-clicked on "References" and selected 
"Add Service Reference". The 3 external services in my example use the following URLs:

	- https://airporttransferservice.azurewebsites.net/airporttransfer.svc
	- https://holidaybrokerservice.azurewebsites.net/holidaybroker.svc
	- https://universitytermtimeservice.azurewebsites.net/universitytermtimes.svc

If you wish to test the services locally it is important to disable the "HTTPS Only" for each service on Azure as
it will automatically block HTTP connections from the local IIS server due to it not having SSL set up by default.
Once the MyVacationWorkflow project has been updated to with the service references and tested on a local machine
the whole process can be published to Azure using the same process as the other 3 services. My copy of this 
service can be found at:

	- https://myvacationwcfworkflow.azurewebsites.net/MyVacationWorkflow.xamlx
